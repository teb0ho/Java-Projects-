September 16, 2016 - Lottery Program v0.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A simple java console program that generates 6 lottery numbers at execution

To ensure that this program executes hassle free execute the following commands from the root directory.

```
javac -d bin src/Lottery.java

java -cp bin Lottery

```
Or you can just run the compiled code as there is a class that is already compiled. By running the following command in the root directory.

If the ```javac ``` command does not work on your CLI you might need set environment variables for your JDK.
